  There is a feature in Prototypo called components. What are those and how to use them? You will see that in this quick tutorial.

## Components?

>You found a template that fits your needs but it's not quite right?
>How about the new Spectral template, but without serifs? Or maybe only the serifs on the left?
>The components might be the right tool for you!

![Component - Basics](components-base.gif)

The components are modular blocks that can be applied to a glyph like serifs, dot or accent style.
By using the components, you can quickly add or remove shapes in a glyph, allowing you to quickly change the overall design of a template.

### Where to find those

![Component - Adding serifs](adding-serifs.gif)

You can open the components view by clicking on the **square and triangle icon** on the **glyph view** (usually in the bottom-left corner of your screen).

### Using them

![Component - green zones](green-zones.gif)

Once you open the component view, you may or may not see grey zones in some parts of the glyph.
**Not all glyphs can have components. However, we are regularly adding new ones for varions glyphs.**
If a glyph can have components, there is two possible cases:

![Component - hasComponent](hasComponent.png) This glyph have a component applied at this position

![Component - hasComponentNone](hasComponentNone.png) This glyph can have a component applied at this position but none is currently set.

To apply or change a component, click on the component icon (the circle or the grey shape), and click on the component you want to apply on the menu that just opened.

### In the future 

We are planning to add new features to components: 
* Manually edit the components
* Create a group similar to the individualization group and get all component changes made on this group applied to all members.

Stay tuned for the new updates!
 
### That's the end of our quick tutorial about components. I hope you will find this feature useful to your needs!
