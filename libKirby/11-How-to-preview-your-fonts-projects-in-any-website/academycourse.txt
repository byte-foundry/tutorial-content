Right under the select list, you have an icon to select an element on the page. Click on it and move your mouse around the page to see elements being highlighted. Once you have targeted the element, click to apply and wait for the font to load.

### Using a custom CSS selector

If you want to select more elements at a time, you can use the power of CSS selectors to target multiple elements at the same time. If you don't know HTML and CSS, you can learn the basics on the excellent [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Selectors) and [this CSS Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/).

Now, you just have to enter your selector in the field and you will see all the matching elements highlighted on the page. Click apply to inject the selected font on the page.
