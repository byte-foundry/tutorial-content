###The Golden Thread and the Top bar are essential tools for anyone using Prototypo. They are linked to eachother and give you an access to your projects or to the Typeface you're working on from different angles. In this tutorial we will cover what those tools are and how to use them.

###The Golden Thread is an area in which you will have access to everything you need to navigate between your projects and the Typeface you're working on.


First, let's cover what is inside the Golden Thread in Prototypo:


- You have the Collection icon  which is the "My Collection" button. It leads you to your typeface family collection, containing everything you've already created using Prototypo. When accessing it you can also create a new family, change family names, add variants or delete family.
- You can use this icon to see everything you've already worked on and apply change to the whole "editorial" part of the typeface family: names, styles.

To get back to  the application, simply click on the "Revert Arrow" button

- The Family name of the typeface you're working on: a simple way to both let you know which project you're in and switch from one project to the other.
- You can use it to see which project you're working on and switch from one Typeface Family to the other. A really handy tool when you're working on multiple projects.

- Style of the Typeface you're working on: you can click on that button to add a new variant to the typeface family.
- You can use it to add a new variant or easily switch from one variant (typeface style) to the other. When you click on "Add new variant", a pop-up window will show, you can add a new variant name or choose a variant from the list Prototypo offers you and that Variant's style will be added to your existing typeface along with its specific design details. For example, if you choose to add a Thin Italic version to your existing font, the Variant added this way will be a Thin Italic version.

- All Glyphs button / All glyph slider: those allow you to switch between the All Glyphs view and the Group of Glyph view.
- You can use those to create certain groups of letters which you can modify independently from the rest of the font
